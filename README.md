# FESTIval
FESTIval is a PostgreSQL extension for benchmarking spatial indices.

We are working on to make FESTIval publicly available. The complete documentation of FESTIval will be available soon.

Access https://github.com/accarniel/FESTIval/wiki to see research papers that employed FESTIval for conducting experimental evaluations.

The default datasets of FESTIval are completely specified and publicly available at https://github.com/accarniel/FESTIval/wiki/Default-Datasets. Please, feel free to use them in your experiments.
